# ToDoApp
This Java Swing program builds a To-Do app using JFrame as the main window. It includes a JTextField for typing tasks, a JList to display tasks, and two JButtons for adding and deleting tasks. Tasks are managed using a DefaultListModel which holds the task strings and syncs with the JList. When the "Add Task" button is clicked, the text from the input field is added to the list; when "Delete Task" is clicked, the selected item from the list is removed. The layout uses BorderLayout to organize components: input on top, list in the center, and delete button at the bottom.
